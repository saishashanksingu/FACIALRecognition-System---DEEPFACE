# FACIALRecognition-System---DEEPFACE

Overview

This project is a Facial Recognition System built using the DeepFace framework. The system detects and recognizes human faces in images and videos using deep learning models, enabling applications like identity verification, security authentication, and emotion analysis.

Features

Face Detection: Detects faces in images and video streams.

Facial Recognition: Identifies and verifies individuals using a pre-trained model.

Emotion Analysis: Detects emotions such as happy, sad, angry, etc.

Age & Gender Prediction: Estimates age and gender from facial images.

Real-Time Processing: Supports real-time face recognition using a webcam.

Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language.

DeepFace: Deep learning framework for face recognition and analysis.

OpenCV: Used for image processing and webcam integration.

TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning backend for model processing.

Matplotlib & NumPy: Data visualization and numerical operations.
